The heavier the load the more rpms are needed to keep you from lugging the engine. It racks on the rod bearing/journals, makes the pistons slap the side of the cylinders hard, and if is done enough, could probably break piston rings. In sixth gear at 100 kph this motor, in my cct anyway, whether cruise control on or not is sounding and behaving great at roughly 2400 to 2600 rpms. My idea of lugging and yours may differ greatly, i call lugging only when the motor sounds and reacts sluggishly in whatever gear i happen to be in.
