Homemade Quiet Baffle For V&amp;N Striaghtshots From motorcycleforums.net
So i have a 03 which i have done the stealth exhaust mod where you get a baffle, put your muffler packing around it and then wrap it with teflon tap. The material was very similar to the original stuff, which was baked and beginning to come apart and move around. Drilling is a pretty unscientific way to modify the exhaust. These motorcycle baffles are usually wrapped with fiberglass sheathing.
