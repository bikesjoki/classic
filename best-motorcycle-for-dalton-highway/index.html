Dalton Highway (Haul Road) by Motorcycle Alaska Adventure From adventuremotorcycletravel.com
The bmw r 1200 gs adventure reigns supreme in this territory and is easily the bike of choice amongst the extreme moto adventurers on the dalton. We expect that the best place to get started from the fairbanks area is probably the hilltop cafe, located just north of fox (a small suburb). I have an 890r that seems like it might be a good bike for this trip as it sounds like crashing on rain slick roads is likely at some point. Lastly, the third, most unreliable option is to hitchhike.
