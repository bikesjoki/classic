Granted that doesn�t involve painting the frame/engine, but a good powdercoating on a frame is supposedly $300 or so if you bring the frame to them and at that point you already have the engine out. A custom paint job can run from $1,500 on the low end upwards to $50,000 depending on the artist and the work desired.
