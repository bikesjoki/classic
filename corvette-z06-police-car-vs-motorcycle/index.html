The c7 z06 complete the 1/4 mile in 11.55 seconds at 121.35 mph, while the police explorer took a leisurely 15.78 seconds at 89.50 mph to cover the same distance. That was the case sunday when a yamaha motorcycle and a yellow 2006 corvette z06 were allegedly racing on route 80 west in hackensack, n.j., and collided after they merged into the center lane at the same time. Performance is definitely highlighted with the new corvette z06. More closely related to the c8.r race.
