<p>Keep the aluminum dry and at room temperature, and weld within a few days of cleaning. Preheating an aluminum engine case before welding reduces the chance of cracking. And yes i did the header and i put the polish on a green scrubby pad and worked from the top of the header down ! Has anyone used the shells instead.

I have seen numerous, rather new engines with yellowed clear coatings. Clean the cases again if it isn�t welded within that time. If the cases just need a simple polishing most any good quality metal polish and lots of elbow grease should do the job. From smaller number to larger then wash it with steelwool and soap and water. You might rub right through the plastic coating in time.</p>
