Castrol 4L Power 1 Racing 4T 5w40 4 Stroke Engine Oil at MXstore From mxstore.com.au
My brothers bandit 1200 is picky about oil and the 10w40 works well in it. The 10w40 motor oil is better used in hot weather or heavy loads. At very high temperatures, you may actually damage the engine since the oil would be too thin to protect the metal surfaces from coming into contact with each other. When using 10w40 oil, it is 6 times thicker and useful for less hot climates.
