Should I Buy OEM Hard Lowers? Victory Motorcycles Motorcycle Forums From thevog.net
For a long time, dunno how long, i just know its been a long time, i�ve wanted to get hard lowers for my street glide. Imho the hard lowers don�t let enough airflow thru and are hot in warm weather no matter how they are adjusted, not to mention you have to change to the tubular crash bars. With the single rear shock suspension common on modern motorcycles, the easiest way to reduce your ride height is by replacing the linkage connecting the bottom of your shock absorber to the bike. Making a template and cut the lowers.
