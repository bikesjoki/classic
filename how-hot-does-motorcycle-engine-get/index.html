<meta name="description" content="How Hot Does Motorcycle Engine Get, I was posting to someone else�s thread in the general section of this forum about engine temp on my 2014 superlow 1200t. I can only assume it�s because the heat of the engine fins is so high that even 100 degree air temp is significantly lower and still cools the engine.

Ordinarily, the temperatures of the muffler are usually between 300 to 500 degrees f. Air will flow down to the catalytic converter, where it will be blown out with waste or exhaust gases. Engine overheating causes a major issue for motorcyclists during long rides and also while stuck in traffic for long hours. Once you discover your harley’s engine is overheating, pull over to the roadside and turn off your bike.
