Take the gas cap off and tear the check valve off the bottem of gas cap. Just install the valve into the gas line 4$ and you can run the carb dry for storage. If you got a crankcase full of gasoline without the engine just sitting you have a bad vacuum fuel cut off and at least float valve that didn�t work. A leaking gas valve can do more than just waste gasoline.

<p>If you got a crankcase full of gasoline without the engine just sitting you have a bad vacuum fuel cut off and at least float valve that didn�t work. Over a pan suitable for containing gasoline, remove the fuel bowl nut and the fuel bowl. I was curious to see how this would turn out, so i filled it up. 2001 01 Yamaha YZ125 YZ 125 Engine LH Left Crankcase Crank Case Bottom.</p>

<p>I added some gas as the tank was empty. Could not find why gas in crankcase. Do you have a cylinder that isn�t running and letting the fuel run down into the crankcase? The stuck float is a common problem on all carbuerated engines. Upon further examination, gasoline had apparently filled the crankcase while the starter was cranking.

<p>As stated above its an injector leaking if you truely are getting gas in the oil. This again only proves that the carburetor can flood if supplied enough fuel. The pulse is very fast so there is enough to drive the fuel to run the engine and still allow the gas into the crankcase. Clean/dry the plug as well.

This situation is called gas washing the engine. Checked float valves made float level a little lower, but never seemed to be an issue anyway. Probably the float got stuck and the carb�s fuel inlet valve didn�t cut off the fuel flow when the float was stuck, so the gas kept dribbling in. I added some gas as the tank was empty. Clean/dry the plug as well.</p>
<p>To check, lift the tank, and put 2~3 feet of fuel line on the petcock, leading into a container. The stuck float is a common problem on all carbuerated engines. After about 15 seconds of cranking, transmission oil spewed out of the crankcase breather. <em>12MM MINI Crankcase Breather BLACK Rogue Motorcycles</em>, Hence the need for using filters and changing oil.</p>
