<p>Lucas oil stabilizer is such thick oil it will delay the engine’s oil to reach vital engine components. I use the oil treatment in my freshly rebuilt chevy 305 motor, since the 305s usually always run low on oil pressure, at idle. Bottle treats up to 28 gallons of gasoline. After the injector cleaning additive is poured to the near empty tank, you should fill up the tank with fuel and start riding your bike. Lucas designed this motorcycle oil stabilizer to control heat and wear in high performance motorcycles.</p>
