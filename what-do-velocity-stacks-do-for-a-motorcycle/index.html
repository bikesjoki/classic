<p>Search this forum for velocity stack mod and you will find a step by step process of buying two sets of 06/07 oem stacks and making your own equivalent to the hrc stacks for $32!!! The velocity stack (sort of a misnomer) is just an extension of the carb to contain that air/fuel revulsion. You will have more air in and more exhaust out. Us old time hotrodders know that a velocity stack is a good thing for performance, smoothing and forming and reducing turbulence of the air entering a carberator or throttle body.
