throttle won�t snap back help please Club Chopper Forums From clubchopper.com
Tried different combinations of loosening one cable, tightening another, and vice versa. When i rebuilt the carb i didnt remove the butterfly valve or spring but did remove the clip on the other side to clean. If it springs back now then the cables were too tight. Third, disconnect the cable from the carbs and move the throttle linkage itself.
