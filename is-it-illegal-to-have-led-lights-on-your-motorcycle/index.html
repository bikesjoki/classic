Aura Motorcycle LED Light Kit MultiColor Accent Glow Neon Strips From br.pinterest.com
Under north carolina law, it is illegal to sell or own a motorcycle that does not have a brake light visible from 100 feet away, unless the motorcycle was manufactured before dec 31, 1955. For states where the lights are illegal, it�s not clear as to why they are illegal. But i can’t imagine there are too many problems with converting the existing lights from bulbs to leds. The reason that led upgrade bulbs can’t be e marked is simply because no legislation exists for the use of led technology in a headlight unit built for halogens.
