A Day Of �Schooling� On Track Made Me A Much Better Rider Than I Ever From carthrottle.com
A bike track day (motorcycle track day) is where you take your own motorcycle to a circuit to ride it on the track. Tires will need at least 50 percent of their tread life left in order to get you safely through an entire track day and you’ll enjoy your track day a lot more if you have new or nearly new tires. According to riding in the zone, a track day can cost anywhere from $150 to $300 per day. Requirements vary but generally you will need to swap out your coolant for distilled water, tape up all mirrors/lenses, and possibly safety wire a few things like your oil plug &#43; filter.
