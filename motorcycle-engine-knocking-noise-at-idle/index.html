Bad Knocking noise Motorcycle Forum From motorcycleforums.net
When your vehicle engine knocks, it means that it produces pinging, knocking or banging sounds. Valve knocking is caused by the timing being off, even by just one tooth. So, even if your car is idle, a knocking engine will cause excessive damage if you hear knocking sounds. The knock also sounded like it was coming from the heads so this went on like this until a few weeks ago now this knock can be heard at idle, where before i had to be giving it throttle and still when the engine is cold, once warm it seems to go away.
