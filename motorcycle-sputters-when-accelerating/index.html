Bmw sputters From automotorpad.com
It started about 2 months after i had the petcock diaphragm recall done when i ran out of gas and had to switch to reserve. I hope someone can help me figure out why my 2007 1300r all of a sudden started sputtering when i gas it at the low to mid rpm level of each gear. Is the engine lite on? My fa50 suzuki 1985 had the same prob, i could rev it a lil but as soon as i revved it while on it, it would cut off.
