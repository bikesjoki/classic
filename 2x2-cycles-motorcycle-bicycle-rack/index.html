<p>Once in place the two locking arms swing into place. The 2×2 rack is currently available for honda, bmw, kawasaki, ktm, harley davidson, suzuki, yamaha, triumph, aprilla, and ducati motorcycles. I had mine changed to accept 15mm axle and done professionally by local engineering. The weight distribution is quite alright, as the 2x2 motorcycle bicycle rack feels lighter than a pillion passenger and won�t affect riding too much, provided you�re not riding hayabusa at 160 mph.
