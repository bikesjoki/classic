If your gearbox oil level is below the suggested capacity, your gears will miss their shifts. In rare cases, a bad tcm can cause it. The trick to getting this right is to get the downshift done as quickly as possible so you don’t let the engine speed drop off too much. If you’ve got a dead battery you won’t be able to “bump start” your cvt driven motorcycle.
