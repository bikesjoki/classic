Your alternator may not be functioning properly. Whilst we think of these as being either 6 or 12v, this is a slight misnomer as the actual voltages are rarely these values if the battery is in good health. Will a motorcycle battery freeze?

<p>Whilst we think of these as being either 6 or 12v, this is a slight misnomer as the actual voltages are rarely these values if the battery is in good health. Watch the meter, and rev it between idle and 5k rpms. My test was put a voltage meter on the battery start the bike watch the voltage it may.

<p>The next time i rode was a 5 days later. Everything is tight and no cables or wires are crossed connected to the battery. Charging times will vary depending on type of charger and the size of the battery. Check the battery for signs of physical damage. Follow the metal tube coming out of it going to the rear brake.

<p>In this scenario, the air/fuel mixture can ignite while the piston is still on the upward stroke, obviously this isn’t the most efficient way to run an engine. Check the battery for signs of physical damage. Then follow by unscrewing the positive terminal. Charge the battery fully and go riding. Watch the meter, and rev it between idle and 5k.

Let it cool down 6 to 12 hours and resume charging.. Pin by Rusty Johnson on Motor Cafe racer girl, Motorcycle riding.</p>
