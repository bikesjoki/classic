Knocking noise from front wheel motorcycles From reddit.com
Vroom (and variant spelling) is an onomatopoeia that represents the sound of an engine revving up. It comes and goes and is pretty loud. As soon as you give any throttle, normal engine noise and exhaust noise becomes loud enough to where you don�t hear it anymore. As the engine speeds up, the frequency of the noise will increase, but you can hear it at any engine speed.
