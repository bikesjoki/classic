It makes cleaning and polishing easy, so you can spend less time in the garage and more time on the road. If you want a cleaner that is effective on dirt, yet gentle on your bike’s paint, then this is an excellent option to turn to. I always used soap and water,but i want to take extra care on this bike. Not ideal for carrying on the bike but great for helping you get your lid clean when you get home.
