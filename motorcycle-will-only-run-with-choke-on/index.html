It means your motorcycle is not getting enough fuel, and this can be caused by dirty or clogged pilot jets, clogged fuel line, clogged fuel filter, dirty petcock, loss of vacuum in the carburetors, among other carburetor issues.
71 CB350 only runs on choke for a short period. From hondatwins.net
A choke richens the mixture and causes the rpm to rise. Try opening the filler cap and leave it open, make sure the kill switch is in the run position. Most likely, it is clogged or there is too much dirt on it. A dirty pilot jet from old fuel can also cause the bike to die when you switch off the choke.
