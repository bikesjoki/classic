<p>(the vertical axis is marked in increments of 2 m/s and the horizontal axis is marked in increments of 4 s.) find the displacement of the person for each of the segments a, b, and c. Find the average acceleration of the motorcycle during segment a of the motion, find the average acceleration of the motorcycle during segment b of. A particle moves according to the law of motion SE.</p>
<h3 id="a-particle-moves-according-to-the-law-of-motion-se-this-gives-two-ms-squared-b">A particle moves according to the law of motion SE This gives two m/s squared b.</h3><p>Find the average acceleration of the motorcycle during each of the following segments of the motion: A motorcycle moves according to the velocity versus time graph shown in the figure. So if we look to the the graph, we can see that first segment segment a we go from velocity zero velocity 10 in just five seconds. A motorcycle has a constant acceleration of 2.5 m/s 2. An object is moving according to displacement(x) vs velocity(v) graph as shown in the figure. Find the average acceleration of the motorcycle during segment a of the motion, find the average acceleration of the motorcycle during segment b of the motion, find the average acceleration of the motorcycle during segment c of the motion.</p>
<p>Express your answer using two significant figures. We can write the average acceleration as a difference in velocity divided by the difference in time. One could use the formula for the area of a triangle. <em>A particle moves according to the law of motion SE</em>, (a) a, (b) b, and (c) c solution:</p>
