Reasons Why Your Motorcycle Will Only Run With The Choke On From ridersturf.com
The fact that you adjusted the mix screws and didn�t get any results further indicates that the carbs are not properly functioning. However, you start it up on choke and everything is fine until you turn the choke off, and the engine dies. If you�ve got it running, and you don�t want to pull apart the carbs, dump a whole can of seafoam in the tank. If i try and pull the choke out, the engine will still run at 1/2 choke, but with no choke it will die.
