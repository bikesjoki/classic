Early spring or late fall we went to 10w. The difference between 10/30 and 10/40 is almost certainly far less important than regular oil changes at the recommended or even lower, if the bike is used irregularly, intervals. This post is not being displayed. Generally better in warm weather.

<p>This oil weight is commonly used in diesel engines or in a smaller motorcycle engine too. A good cheap alternative is diesel 15w40 oil.
