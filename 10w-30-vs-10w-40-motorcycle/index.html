Honda GN4 Motorcycle 10W40 SCL From shop.sclubricants.com
Early spring or late fall we went to 10w. The difference between 10/30 and 10/40 is almost certainly far less important than regular oil changes at the recommended or even lower, if the bike is used irregularly, intervals. This post is not being displayed. Generally better in warm weather.

<p>It is recommended to use oil with the viscosity index recommended by the manufacturer to ensure the best performance of the vehicle engine. But when the temperature is higher, both motor oils similarly perform their intended functions (using the same viscosity). Using the correct viscosity oil eases starting, reduces friction, and slows wear. The 5w30 has a viscosity of 30. Castrol Power 1 Motorcycle Engine Oil 4 Stroke 10W40 1 Litre 1L.</p>

<p>Oil that is able to maintain its thickness at high operating temperatures has many benefits to show for. 30 weight, however might give you a teensy bit more power, since the engine can devote less of its power to pushing oil about, and more to moving the wheels.
