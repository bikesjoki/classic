Honda GN4 Motorcycle 10W40 SCL From shop.sclubricants.com
Early spring or late fall we went to 10w. The difference between 10/30 and 10/40 is almost certainly far less important than regular oil changes at the recommended or even lower, if the bike is used irregularly, intervals. This post is not being displayed. Generally better in warm weather.
