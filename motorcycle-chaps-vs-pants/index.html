Pants cover your butt, not so much with chaps. Motorcycle chaps are a great option for protecting your legs in the event of a crash or accident. Pants are great and we recommend wearing them, but when you need more protection for the ride, grab a pair of chaps to toss over your pants and get riding. Equipped with laminated 2l drystarxf waterproof and highly breathable membrane they provide superior comfort in any weather conditions, wet or dry.
