The calculated decelerations were 0.36 g and 0.29 g. Car and motorcycle tires skid on typical good quality roads with a deceleration rate of between 0.85 and 0.9g�s. Deceleration has actually referred to the acceleration in a reverse way. The physics behind this is actually quite simple.

The physics behind this is actually quite simple.</h3><p>If the motorcycle has a deceleration of at=−(0.001s) m/s2 and its speed at position a is 24 m/s , determine the magnitude of its acceleration when it passes point b. We know that acceleration means the rate at which an object speeds up, that means deceleration means the rate at which an object slows down. A motorcycle that backfires when you let off the throttle is running too lean. For both tire pressures (20 psi and 40 psi), the level of deceleration achieved in the tests was in the range of those reported by other studies. However, the measured deceleration signal not only origins from the braking forces generated at the wheels. Also aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance have an effect on the.</p>
