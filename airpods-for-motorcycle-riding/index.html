<meta name="description" content="Airpods For Motorcycle Riding, Personally, i’ve only found two concrete benefits for utilizing a pair of earbuds while riding a motorcycle. When it comes to charging, these earbuds last up to 15 hours per charge.
Apple AirPods Pro IMBOLDN From imboldn.com
Charging is effortless with the included usb cable, and can even be done when you’re out on the bike. I use the airpods if i�m travelling for short distance. Airpod pros are a better option as they provide noise cancellation and have custom tips making them less likely to fall out, however neither are optimal for riding a motorcycle. Cycling with the apple airpods if you are looking for that extra motivation on your next training ride, taking your favorite tunes with you can make all the difference.
