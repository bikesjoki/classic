Copdock Motorcycle Show returns to Trinity Park for its 28th show From classicbikeguide.com
The following is a list of the clubs that attended the 2019 show in our club village with links to their club sites. A donation of £5 per vehicle is asked, with all proceeds going to an as yet undecided local good cause. Each year the hard working committee try to improve on the previous year’s show and copdock classic motorcycle club believe their 28th show, with allen millyard as this year’s guest of honour, could be their best yet. That is a fantastic amount and your kind gift and support is very much appreciated.
