I often see riders who roll through a stop sign and are turning, make the turn far too wide, almost crossing or actually crossing the yellow line. Fine amounts differ by area but generally range from $25 to $300. Doing so at any time can warrant a traffic violation ticket that can cost you up to $125 in florida. As crazy as it sounds, all too often a car won’t see a motorcycle that is stopped directly in front of them.
